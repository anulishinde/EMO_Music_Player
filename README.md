emotion-based-music-player
This is a project using machine learning for detecting emotions based on the expression of the users. The interface is made up of HTML, CSS and JS, and the main code is of Python.


This code is developed in Visual Studio Code, with eel , opencv and Python downloaded.  
For running the code in Windows or Mac, certain path changes are required.


Please make sure you have the following in your machine...

Note: I have downloaded python
Python version: 3.9.0 (Try to download all python modules)(Important modules: glob, os, numpy, random, argparse, time)
Eel version: 0.9.10
Opencv version: 3.4.3 (Full opencv module. Fisherface module is must)
Chrome browser is needed (eel library is specifically designed for chrome)

Download all the files in a folder. Open terminal in the same folder. 

Type the command 'python main.py' in terminal. 

A window will open in chrome browser having the interface of the player. Select emotion mode from the right bottom corner. This will start the webcam. Face will be scanned in the ending of the currently playing song. You can manually move the song controller near the end to start the function. 

When emotion is detected, you can see the name of the emotion in the terminal open.
